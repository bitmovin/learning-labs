# Learning Lab - Sample javascript/html/css OTT app
This repository is to create a simple OTT platform with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bitmovin components. 
The OTT app is based on a users' personal Instagram stories. After the videos have been encoded, this repository shows how to put the basic elements of a video based Over the Top application together and playback the encoded videos. 
The app's functionalities are:
- Specify an input source list, with information for analytics tracking.
- Define the config for the Bitmovin player
- Instantiate the player and load initial source on the page
- Add the list of available videos to the page
- Show the video title and timing out text for each video
- Navigate the videos forwards and backwards
- TV channel like functionality, play one video after the current one ends.

The visual outcome of the app is:
